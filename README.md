# Super-efficient Echocardiography Video Segmentation via Proxy- and Kernel-Based Semi-supervised Learning (AAAI-2023)
The official implementation for the AAAI-2023 paper "Super-efficient Echocardiography Video Segmentation via Proxy- and Kernel-Based Semi-supervised Learning".

Due to the confidentiality agreement in commercial cooperation, we only provide codes of core modules and the whole trainable models for the convenience of comparisons.

## Requirements

* CUDA/CUDNN
* PyTorch >= 1.9.1
